approved by the community

## Features

- Shows how the word should be camelized following the community guidelines
- Camelizes words using [lodash.camelcase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.camelcase) if no community definition is provided 
- Supports camelization of words with the following delimiters `-`, `_`, ` `(space)
- Description is displayed in HTML, but is also kept in this repo under `src/resources`

## Contributing
In order to add a description to a specific camelization, please execute the following steps
1. Crete a markdown file inside `/resources` all lowercase
2. Add content to the markdown file using the following format

``` markdown
### Readonly

Readonly is a [closed compound word](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/open-and-closed-compound-words/#react-view:~:text=Closed%20Compound%20Words,-Closed) and should _not_ be camelized

``` 

Append an object to the existing array inside `src/resources/camelArray.ts`

``` javascript
  {
    id: ADD_ONE_TO_LAST_INDEX,
    normalized: "myword", // All lowercase and without diacritics (use normalization tool)
    camelCase: "myWord", // The way you think the word should be camelized
    description: descriptions.myword, // path to description markdown file
  },
``` 

Add markdown file path to `src/resources/index.ts`
```javascript
const myword = raw("./descriptions/myword.md");
```
This step needs to be followed as `raw` parses the word and transforms it into a string.

Append the parsed string to the export statement below the latest word
``` javascript
const descriptions = {
  ...
  myword,
}; 
```

#### Note

All uncovered words will fall under the template model
and {{WORD}} occurrences will be replaced

``` markdown
### {{WORD}}

Sorry ‚òπÔ∏è , No description has been found for **{{WORD}}**, but it should be safe to use it as displayed above,
since it has been generated by lodash's [camelcase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.camelcase) module.

Please [submit a PR](https://github.com/mauriciotasca/camelize) if you think there should be a different way to camelize **{{WORD}}**.
